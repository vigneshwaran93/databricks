print("A. Python is an indent based programming language")
#Why Python uses indend based programing ->
#1. Managing the program more efficiently
#2. Better Readablility of the code
#3. For creating the hierarchy of programming.
#4. By default 4 spaces we will give for indends, but more/less spaces or tabs also can be used...

#Indendation is needed for (hierarchy of programming), because we are doing block operation (lines of code) with in the for loop


#Linux is not an intend based program, it is a block based rather:


#indendation has to be uniform within the block of code (not across the block of code)
#below prog doesnt work because we are using different number of spaces between lines of code in a given block


#below prog doesnt work because we are using different keys like spaces for one line and tab for another line


#optimal number of spaces has to be 4, but any numbers you can give


print("B. This is a commented line in Python")


print("C. Playing with Quotes: Python treats single quotes the same as double quotes as like triple quotes, but has some differences")
#Python treats single quotes the same as double quotes and triple quotes.

##we can use escape sequence also

#Double quotes is used for holding single quoted chars

#Triple double quotes is used for muliline
#For handling paragraph/multilines text, we can use 3 single or doublequotes

#Any programming language learning has to be started first learning about variables
print("Let's learn all about VARIABLES")
'''1. Variable Properties - Dynamic Inference, Dynamic Typed, Strongly Typed'''

#Dynamic inference - based on the assigned value to a variable, it will automatically decides/infer/identify/refers the data type dynamically

#Dynamically typed: If a variable is created with a specific data type, can be changed later

#below is possible, because python is dynamically typed language (Duck type language)


'''Scala is a statically typed language

#below is not possible - because of statically type feature

'''

#Strongly typed: Python allow us to operate between the variables of same datatype (of the same hierarchy) and doesn't allow to operate between different datatypes.


print("E. Naming Conventions")
#A variable can have camel case or init upper or with underscores


#A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character

#A variable name cannot start with a number


#A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )


#Variable names are case-sensitive


#Multiple Variables can be assigned in a single line (Multi Assignment)


print("F. Types & Casting")

#3. How to check a given TYPE is of what datatype we expect  & type casting
#Functions we are learning in this topic ()


#What we are learning here is the usage of few functions like
#To understand the age is of what type

#To check wheter the age is of an expected type

#To convert the age to an expected type


#Check for a given type, if it is not as expected then cast it to the expected type programatically using if condition


print("G. Standard Input & output options")

#Positional arguments

#keyword/named arguments

#Formatted string Print statements other way (3x onwards) - named args

print("H. Datatypes, Mutability & Builtin Functions")
#Sequence Types
#string type -
# indexed sequenced collection of characters/literals
# can be assigned with single, double, triple single/double quotes

#Hints

#Numeric Types
#int type

#float type

#exponential


#Misc Types
#bool types: used for performing logical and conditional operations

# complex numbers:

#None -

#bytes - used for converting the values to byte/binary format before transfer across the network or for processing in a secured fashion

#Complex types - list, tuples, set, dict we learn later

print('G. Operators')
#Python supports operators -> assignment, arithmatic, comparison/relational, logical,
# unary (least priority), binary (least priority), ternary (least priority), bitwise (least priority)

#Assignment Operators ()- used to assign some values to a variable - return the value/reference as a result


#Arithmatic Operators () - will returns operated value as a result


#Relational operators () - Used for comparing variables and values and returns boolean type as a result


#Logical Operators () - apply logic between multiple output of the relational operators and Returns boolean
#or -

#and -

#not -

#Bitwise Operators (&, |) - same like logical operator (Costly to use) -

#Unary

#Binary

#Ternary

#One program covers almost all these operators

###########One Reallife usecase program to bring all types of operators in one Program###########
#Swiggy food purchase -> coupon max discount of 100 or 10% which ever is lesser


print('J. Conditional Structure')

#I can/must/minimum have if condition alone -
#I must have if condition with else statement -
#I can have only else if or else statement -
#I can have if condition with else condition alone -
#I can have if condition with else if condition alone -
#I must have if condition with else if condition and else statement also -
#I should have my conditional structure started with if (if should be used only once),
# but can have multiple elif and should have only one else

#Minimal Conditional Structure

#Conditional Structure with multiple condition

#Nested conditional structure, which has to be used appropriately, needs lot of iterative testing


#Quick Usecases:
#Usecase1: Find the greatest of 2 and then 3 numbers using built in functions (max(list of values))

#Usecase2:
# "if" user clicked on the popup then provide the options available upcoming batch or ask anything
# "if" user choosen upcoming batch -> ask user to choose either de or ds or cloud or devops else inform course is not available
# "if" user choosen ask anything ->

print('J. Looping Constructs')
#Looping Construct concepts ->
'''
Category -> 
Conditional looping (entry & exit) eg. while i<=j or while True (do while loop) 
Un Conditional looping - for loop
Types (for, while + do while - not available directly in python (rather we use while True (exit controlled)))
break -> break will terminate the iteration of a loop and come out of the loop 
& continue -> continue will skip the iteration of a loop and continue to the next iteration
'''
#Iteration or repetitive execution of the some tasks across data or programs is called loops
#Two way of Performing Looping - Conditional & UnConditional loopings

#for loop is an unconditional looping


#A Realtime Example of for loop on a list of salary (Unconditional Looping)


#while loop is a conditional looping


#Realtime example of a conditional looping


#Let's try to understand the looping concept in detail with some case studies including the other constructs like break and continue:
#First lets' learn For loop -
#For loop will run on an iterable type only
#For loop is a unconditional looping
#For loop - number of iterations are already known


#How to write a simple for loop


#Nested For loop
#I wanted to calculate bonus applied salary


#for empname,sal in emp_lst,sal_lst:#We can't iterate on more than one list using a single looping construct
#    print(f"bonus applied salary for {empname} is ",int(sal+(sal*(bonus_percent/100))))
#This below approach for finding empname and the salary of the given employee, will not work as we expected


#Let's try with Nested looping: The below nested looping will not work


#Let's try with Nested looping: Using an important function called "enumerate" we can get the index also with the element and apply in other list


#When Do we use Nested For loop
#An University wanted to provide the subjects to all affliated colleges



#For Loop with Break and Continue constructs/clauses:
#Break is used to break the execution of the loop by come out of the loop if a given condition matches
#Continue is used to skip the given iteration of the loop (and execute the next iteration) if a given condition matches


#Let's fine tune the above looping construct to only iterate the required number of times
# (3 times only rather than 5 times)
#The loop will run only 5+1 times


#Break is only effective if we sort the data?
#exists in sql's


#continue construct: continue will help skip the current iteration and continue with the next iteration


#Usecase1: Try create tables for your kids from 2 to how many tables (get as an input)?
# using simple or nested for loop, skip the 5 and 10 tables
#Table has to created upto 12 numbers


#While Loop

#Looping constructs available in Common Prog languages - for, while and do while
#Looping constructs available in Python language - for and while (no do while is available in python)
#Types of Looping - Entry Control & Exit Control loops


#All about While loop:
#
#
#


#How to create infinate loop using while to run some process/operation continuously
#In the other hand if we don't manage the conditions properly, it will leads to infinate looping


#Convert the for loop into while loop - conclude which is better to use for iterating list of values? FOR LOOP is considerable


#Realtime Example of using While loop: Entry controlled loop
#Login username/password used in our routine life
# username=input("User name\n")
# storedpasswd="hduser"
# attempts=1
# maxattempts=3


#Usecase2 related to exit controlled loop (do while loop) + break & continue:
#Create a scheduler program to run a code minimum once or continue to run multiple hours + skipping odd hours
#eg. sfm_insure.py (some print statement)

#What is a collection type?

#Examples of Collection Types:

#list


#dictionary


#tuple


#set


#Notataions:

#Example of all collection types used:
#{'process': 'ETL Process1', 'source': {'hive', 'Bigquery'}, 'target': ['HDFS', 'GCS'], 'cols': ['custid', 'upper(custname) as upper_custname'], 'tablename': 'customer', 'where': "(city='chennai')", 'uris': ('gcs://abc/xyz_bucket/', 100)}

#Different types of collection types? in the order of importance
#list, dict, tuple, set

#Why we need collection types?
#To manage/store/parse the complex dataset in a hirarchical/nested/complex structure stored or to process semi structure data, nested data,
# dynamic schema-ful data (avro), variable data/metadata, for a data or metadata driven approaches..

#Different characteristics of collection types?
#Iterable (looping), mutable (changable) - updatable (modifyable) & resizable (added/removed), accessible (select using index, position, value, key)

######What are the topics we have to learn in collection types#######
#Iterable? Yes, all collection types are iterable in python.

#Notation, access, resizable/mutable/immutable?  insert/update/delete, functions to apply
#All the above we are going to see in detail
#Notation:
#Accessed using ?
#Definition: Indexed, sequenced collection of homogeneous elements

print("list operations")
#List can be hetrogeneous too (but not suggested, why ? because while operate between the elements of the list, program fails because python is a strongly typed language)


#All the python collections are iterable -


#select/access


#insert/update/delete (list is mutable, hence updating and resizing (add/removing) is possible)

#append in the last (proves list is mutable/resizable/can be inserted)


#insert in the index position


#update the list elements (mutable)

#delete the elements of the list using value


#delete multiple same elements using the value


#pop (delete) the elements of the list using index


print("list after popping out a given index element")

#search for a value with in the given index (range) value and pop(remove) it

print("Dictionaries (mutable) - {k:v, k:v}")


#Access a dictionary - using key


#Adding Items - if the key is not found


#Updating Items - if the key is found


#Removing an Item (from the last)

#Delete(pop) the given key

#Delete all the elements of a dict
#dict1.clear()


#Iteration of Dictionary
#Iterate on the items of the Dict - will return what datatype???tuple


#Iterate on the keys of the Dict - will return what datatype???respective key's datatype


#Iterate on the values of the Dict - will return what datatype???respective value's datatype

#Some additional functions

#Setdefault will add the key and value provided if key is not present already, if already present consider the given value and not the default value

#create a dictionary with the keys from list and value from the second argument


print("Tuples (immutable?)")
#Definition of Tuple:Tuple is an indexed sequenced collection of hetrogeneous elements, tuples are immutable (non updatable and non resizable)
#Notation is ()


#select/access
#City where Anirudh present

#count of some element in the given tuple

#search for some element in the given tuple to identify the index


#Resizable? No (insert/delete)
#Try to Add some elements to the tuple, lets try to add age of Anirudh
#Insert/Append? No


#delete? No
#tup1.__delattr__(name="Chennai") #cannot delete the elements of tuple

#Modify (update) - Not possible


#I want to achieve Insert/update/Delete in a tuple? Not possible by default,
# but we can do some workaround to achieve it? convert to list , do insert update delete and convert back to tuple

#Do all operations/functions that list supports (#Other functions to apply)
#Insert


#Update

#Delete


#Convert the list back to tuple

#The number of elements/items in the set is not fixed in the numbers or sort order
#set1[0] #not possible to access using index

#set is iterable?yes


#set is mutable?Yes
#add will help add/update an element not the set

#update will help add/update another set


#set is mutable (resizable) - Removing/popping/cleaning


#set is supported with set operation (If we use set, we use it for these purposes)
#Requirement of identifying the common department in the given lists

#intersect - combine both the sets


#difference (difference/subtract/minus) - find the difference between the sets
